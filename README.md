# Hardware-accurate-RGB-slang-shader-presets
These shader presets are console specific and intended to be used in retroarch to look as they appeared on the original systems as if they were hooked up to a CRT television with RGB SCART cables. It's recommended to place these shaders in the directory \RetroArch\shaders or \RetroArch\shaders\shaders_slang\crt

These shaders were put together by using GTU for all of the CRT effects and appearance and tvout-tweaks with the TV colour levels and resolutions adjusted to match the hardware RGB outputs for each specific console.
