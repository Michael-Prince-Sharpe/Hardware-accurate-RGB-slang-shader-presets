# Hardware-accurate-RGB-SCART-slang-shader-presets
These shader presets are intended to be used in RetroArch to look as they appeared on the original systems as if they were hooked up to a CRT television with RGB SCART cables. It's recommended to place these shaders in the directory \RetroArch\shaders or \RetroArch\shaders\shaders_slang\crt

These shaders were put together by using GTU for all of the CRT effects and appearance and adjusting the horizontal resolution for definition to match the hardware RGB outputs for each console.
