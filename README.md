# Hardware-accurate-RGB-SCART-slang-shader-preset
This shader preset is intended to be used in RetroArch to look as it appeared on the original systems as if they were hooked up to a CRT television with RGB SCART cables. It's recommended to place this shader in the directory \RetroArch\shaders or \RetroArch\shaders\shaders_slang\crt

This shader was put together by using GTU for all of the CRT effects and appearance and tvout-tweaks for the TV colour levels and definition to match the hardware RGB outputs for consoles.
